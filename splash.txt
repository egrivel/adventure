The year is 3012 UST (Universal Stellar Time). Ever since faster than light
travel was discovered in 2415, humanity has been expanding to the stars. By
now, thousands of planets have been colonized.

Hank is a college dropout. At age 22, he decided heâ€™d rather see the galaxy
than study. He scraped together enough money for a one-way ticket to some
random planet, packed his backpack, and headed out. The planet he ended up at
is called Grayson and is far away from most regular interstellar shipping
lines. His ticket included a complementary three-night stay at the Grayson
Hilton. Hank has been exploring Grayson City for the past three days. Now
he wakes up on the morning of the fourth day.

It is clearly time someone with a better sense of responsibility takes
control of Hank&rsquo;s life.

About the Game

The game is a text adventure, meaning the player interacts with the game by
typing commands into a text box; the game responds with one or more lines of
text. Part of the fun is discovering the commands as you go along. Carefully
read the text as it contains clues as to what is possible.

Most commands start with an action (verb) and are often followed by a noun
indicating what to apply the action to. A few examples:

look: looks around and describes where you are.<br/>
look object: looks at the object and describes it.<br/>
take object: pick up the object.<br/>
drop object: drop the previously picked up object.<br/>
inventory lists the things you are carrying with you.

Moving around is mostly done by go and a direction:<br/>
go east<br/>
go north

Some special commands are:<br/>
save filename: save the current state of the game in the file filename.<br/>
load filename: load the previously saved state of the game from filename.

Hints

The game has a limited vocabulary, and finding the right terms can be
tricky. Try the command hint to get ideas. Usually the hints are pretty
generic, but depending on where you are the game can give more specific hints.
